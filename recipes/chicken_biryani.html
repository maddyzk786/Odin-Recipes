<p>Chicken biryani is a popular variation of the biryani dish that uses chicken as the main protein. The chicken is marinated in a mixture of spices and yogurt to enhance its flavor and tenderness. The dish is made by layering the marinated chicken with basmati rice that has been cooked in a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, cardamom, and cloves. The layers are then cooked together over low heat to allow the flavors to blend and create a delicious, fragrant, and hearty meal. Chicken biryani is a staple dish in South Asian cuisine and is often served during special occasions or celebrations.</p>

<h2>Steps:</h2>

<li>Wash the rice thoroughly in cold water and soak it in enough water for at least 30 minutes.</li>

<li>In a bowl, mix the chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, garam masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder. Marinate the chicken for at least 30 minutes or overnight in the fridge for best results.</li>

<li>Heat ghee or vegetable oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and fry until they turn golden brown. Remove half of the onions and keep them aside for later use.</li>

<li>In the same pan, add the marinated chicken and cook for 10-15 minutes until it is half-cooked. Add chopped tomatoes and cook for another 5 minutes.</li>

<li>In a separate pot, bring water to a boil and add soaked rice along with bay leaves, cinnamon sticks, cardamom pods, and cloves. Cook the rice until it is about 80% done. Drain the excess water and keep the rice aside.</li>

<li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C).</li>

<li>In the same pan, spread the half-cooked chicken mixture evenly. On top of it, layer the rice over the chicken mixture. Sprinkle the saffron milk and fried onions on top.</li>

<li>Cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and place it in the oven. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the chicken is fully cooked and the rice is fluffy.</li>

<li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and serve hot.</li>
