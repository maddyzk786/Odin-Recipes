<p>Paneer tikka is a popular North Indian appetizer that consists of cubed paneer (a type of Indian cheese) that has been marinated in a blend of spices and yogurt, skewered and grilled until crispy and charred. The marinade typically contains spices such as cumin, coriander, and garam masala, along with ginger, garlic, and lemon juice, which infuse the paneer with a flavorful and tangy taste. The paneer tikka is often served with a side of mint chutney or tamarind chutney and is a popular vegetarian alternative to chicken tikka. It is commonly enjoyed at Indian restaurants or as a party snack.</p>
