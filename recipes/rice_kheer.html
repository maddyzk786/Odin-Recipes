<p>Rice kheer is a creamy and aromatic Indian dessert made with rice, milk, sugar, and flavored with cardamom, saffron, and nuts. It is a popular sweet dish that is commonly served during festive occasions or as a special treat after meals. The rice is cooked in milk until it becomes soft and creamy, then sugar and spices are added to enhance the flavor. Nuts such as almonds and cashews are added for a crunchy texture, while saffron lends a golden color and a delicate aroma. Rice kheer can be enjoyed warm or chilled and is a delicious way to end a meal.</p>

<ul>
<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
<li>1/2 cup basmati rice</li>
<li>4 cups whole milk</li>
<li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
<li>1/4 tsp ground cardamom</li>
<li>A pinch of saffron threads</li>
<li>2 tbsp chopped nuts (such as almonds, cashews, or pistachios)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>You can adjust the amount of sugar and nuts to your preference. Also, some people like to add a tablespoon of ghee (clarified butter) for extra flavor, but this is optional.</em></p>

<ol>
<h2>Steps:</h2>

<li>Rinse the basmati rice in cold water and soak it in water for 30 minutes.</li>

<li>Drain the rice and transfer it to a heavy-bottomed pan.</li>

<li>Add 4 cups of whole milk to the pan and bring it to a boil over medium heat. Stir occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.</li>

<li>Once the milk comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and let the rice cook in the milk for 30-40 minutes or until the rice is soft and the milk has thickened, stirring occasionally.</li>

<li>Add 1/2 cup of sugar to the pan and stir to dissolve.</li>

<li>Add a pinch of saffron threads and 1/4 tsp of ground cardamom to the pan and mix well.</li>

<li>Cook for another 5-10 minutes, or until the sugar has dissolved and the kheer has thickened to the desired consistency.</li>

<li>Remove the pan from the heat and let it cool for a few minutes.</li>

<li>Add 2 tbsp of chopped nuts (such as almonds, cashews, or pistachios) to the kheer and mix well.</li>

<li>Transfer the kheer to a serving bowl and garnish with additional chopped nuts, if desired.</li>

<li>Serve warm or chilled.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>You can adjust the amount of sugar and cardamom to your liking. You can also add raisins or other dried fruits to the kheer for added sweetness and texture.</em></p>
